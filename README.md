## General information about analysis.

First you need to configure Google Colab workspace.  After configuring Google Colab try to find unusual patterns in hourly google search traffic.

After that you mine the search traffic data for seasonality and try to find search traffic to stock price patterns.

Then you creat a time series model with Prophet and forecast revenue by using time series models.
